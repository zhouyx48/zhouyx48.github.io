**Amplitude of solar-like oscillations from 3D Convection Simulations**
![solar-interior.png](/images/solar-interior.png)

The Sun is oscillating, with a period of roughly 5 minutes. The oscillation is driven and dissipated by convective motion near the solar surface. However, it is challenging to predict the excitation and damping of oscillation due to the lack of a definite theory of stellar convection. We have made progress in this topic by quantifying the excitation, damping and amplitude of solar oscillation from 3D convection simulations.

**Mode-tide coupling in neutron stars and its dependence on equation of state**
![NS-merger](/images/NS-merger.png)

The equation of state of ultra-dense matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Gravitational waves from binary neutron stars is a promising way to decode this puzzle. We have studied whether the interaction between neutron star oscillation and tidal force, which may be detectable from LIGO, can be used to constrain the equation of state of neutron stars.
